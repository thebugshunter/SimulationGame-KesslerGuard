# Kessler Guard: A Space Debris Cleanup Simulation

Welcome to Kessler Guard, a high-fidelity simulation where you pilot a remote-controlled pod in low-earth orbit to help clean up space debris.

## The Mission

Your mission is critical: to combat the growing threat of space debris and prevent the Kessler Syndrome, a catastrophic scenario where the density of objects in orbit is high enough that collisions could cause a cascade, making space exploration and satellite operations impossible for generations.

In this simulation, you are pioneering the future of remote work, performing essential operations in space, all from the safety of Earth.

## Gameplay

*   **Pilot Your Pod**: Use your keyboard (WASD) and mouse, or the on-screen joysticks, to navigate your advanced cleanup pod through a realistic 3D environment.
*   **Analyze Objects**: Use your ship's scanner and terminal to identify and analyze various objects in orbit, from defunct satellites to natural asteroids.
*   **Utilize Tools**: Equip tools like the Plasma Burner and Magnet to interact with and manage space objects. Be careful—your actions have consequences!

This project was built with Next.js, React, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS.
